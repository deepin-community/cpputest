Description: C/C++ based unit test framework — main package
 CppUTest is a C/C++ based unit xUnit test framework for unit testing and
 for test-driving your code. It is written in C++ but is used in C and C++
 projects and frequently used in embedded systems.
 .
 CppUTest has a couple design principles:
  * Simple to use and small
  * Portable to old and new platforms
 .
 CppUTest also has support for building mocks and can be used by
 practitioners of Test Driven Development.
 .
 This is the main package. It contains some examples, support scripts
 and depends on libcpputest-dev which provides the test framework
 itself.
